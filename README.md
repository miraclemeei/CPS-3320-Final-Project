# CPS-3320-Final-Project
 Final NLP Project Sentimental Analysis
 In this project it totally has two approaches one is using Logistic Regression, 
 another one is the deep learning with the help of Tensorflow
# A starts here

# Here is the guide to run the python-sentilmental-analysis-deep-learning.py file

* Donwload Tensorflow via Command lie use pip install tensorflow
* use python python-sentilmental-analysis-deep-learning.py to run the code in cmd
* It main pop up something like:
> 2022-05-28 13:38:08.218751: W tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:64] Could not load dynamic library 'cudart64_110.dll'; dlerror: cudart64_110.dll not found
2022-05-28 13:38:08.219049: I tensorflow/stream_executor/cuda/cudart_stub.cc:29] Ignore above cudart dlerror if you do not have a GPU set up on your machine.
